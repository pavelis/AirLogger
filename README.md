# Autonomous air pollution logger for a drone

## Concept

An autonomous set which writes PM1.0, PM2.5 and PM10 measurements data from PMS5003 sensor into a MicroSD card.

Equipment:
* Arduino Pro Mini with ATmega328P, 3.3V, 8 MHz
* PMS5003 sensor
* BME280 sensor
* MicroSD module + MicroSD card (I use a 1-GB FAT16-formated card)
* DC-DC step-up converter @5V
* Lithium battery
* Plastic box
* Double-sided scotch tape
